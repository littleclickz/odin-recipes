    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Cupcakes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F &lpar;176&deg;C&rpar;</li>
                <li>Line a 12-muffin tin with baking cups.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>With a mixer, cream the butter and sugar together for approximately 1 minute, or until light and fluffy. Add in the honey and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
                <li>Add in the eggs one at a time, then turn the mixer off and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to make sure there isn't any unmixed butter and sugar.</li>
                <li>With the mixer on low speed, add the buttermilk and flour mixture a little at a time, alternating between each. Mix until evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Add in the lemon zest and dandelion petals, making sure they are evenly incorporated and aren't clumped together.</li>
                <li>Fill each lined muffin tin with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup of the batter and bake for 20&ndash;25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then carefully place them on a wire rack to cool for another 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the cupcakes cool, prepare the frosting.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Lemon Buttercream Frosting</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt.</li>
                <li>Using an electric mixer on medium speed, mix thoroughly until smooth and creamy. Add in the confectioner's sugar <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup at a time, mixing in between until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
                <li>Spread the frosting evenly over the top of the cupcakes. Garnish the cupcakes with dandelion petals or flowers if desired.</li>
            </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>Dandelions are very common and very easy to spot, but you need to find some that aren’t sprayed with harmful chemicals. Be sure to forage from a clean area away from roadsides and heavy foot or pet traffic.</p>
            <p>For this recipe you’ll only need the petals of the dandelion flower, so you can pick just enough flowers to make up <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cups of picked petals. The yellow petals will need to be separated from the green parts, which are bitter.</p>
