    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup softened, salted butter</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup confectioner's or powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>4 tbsp chopped fresh lemon balm</li>
            <li>2 tsp fresh lemon zest or finely chopped lemon rind</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, beat together the butter, chopped herb, fresh lemon zest, and sugar until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and mix well. You may need to use your hands, but be sure not to overwork the dough after the mixture has combined.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is smooth and coming together, roll it into a cylinder shape. Wrap tightly in parchment paper and chill for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, slice about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&quot; thick. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, about 1&quot; apart.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes on a rack placed in the top third of your oven. If your oven is on the hot side, be sure to check the cookies after 6 or 7 minutes to make sure they are not burning.</li>
        </ol>
