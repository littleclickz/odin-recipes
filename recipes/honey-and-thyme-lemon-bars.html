    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Crust</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F and grease an 8&times;8 or 9&times;9 square pan with butter or coconut oil.</li>
                    <li>Stir together the butter or coconut oil and honey until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add the almond flour, arrowroot powder, and salt, and stir until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Spread the mixture in an even layer in the bottom of the prepared pan and bake for 12&ndash;15 minutes or until just barely set and beginning to slightly brown.</li>
                    <li>Remove the crust from the oven and set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Filling</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn oven down to 325&deg;F.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, honey and lemon, then stir in the lemon juice.</li>
                    <li>Whisk in the arrowroot powder and fresh thyme leaves.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture on top of the cooled crust, then bake for 30 minutes or until the lemon bars are just set and only very slightly jiggly in the middle.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool completely, then refrigerate for at least an hour (a few hours is best) before cutting.</li>
                </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>If you don't have fresh thyme available you can omit it and keep them plain. Other herbs that would work well instead of thyme are rosemary or lavender.</p>
            <p>To make these lemon bars paleo, use coconut oil or grass fed ghee instead of butter and paleo powdered sugar for the optional garnish.</p>
            <p>Garnish with a sprinkle of powdered sugar or coconut sugar if desired and a sprig of fresh thyme. Enjoy!</p>
